# ü§î What are these?
These are my little like uh, GDI stuff. Reminder that some are not for the ones that hate flashing lights.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è For N17Pro3426 and skidders
I know that some people will skid some effects after I release these effect's source code to put in their malwares, and even if I complain about it, nothing will change...

So for that reason I added a GPLv3 license. In other words, if you use/modify a part of my code, you need to make your project open source and give me credit!
